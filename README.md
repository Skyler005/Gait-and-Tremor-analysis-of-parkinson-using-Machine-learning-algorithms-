Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive movement illness that affects a sizable
population worldwide. The affected person loses their ability to usually control their movement as
PD worsens. During various phases of the disease, people with Parkinson&#39;s disease have noticeable
symptoms such tremors and gait abnormalities. The gait cycle, which can be divided into different
stages and periods to assess normal and abnormal gait, is used in this project&#39;s unique technique to
diagnose Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD). Initially, the physio Net database was used to collect the raw
force data. The stride time, stance and swing phases, and other temporal parameters can all be
extracted using the pulse duration technique. Tremor is a typical PD symptom. Tremor is a typical
PD symptom. Uncontrollable body movements are referred to as tremors. The tremor may initially
just affect one portion of the body, such as an arm, leg, or one side of the body, but it may
eventually spread to both sides. This rest tremor is an essential PD symptom.. Machine learning
has emerged as a promising approach for detecting PD at an early stage. This project is to develop
a machine learning model to detect Parkinson&#39;s disease (PD) at an early stage. The model uses gait
and tremor analysis and trained different classifiers, achieving good accuracy rates of 85 to 90%
with SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN, and optimized neural networks. The addition
of LSTM and data augmentation improved accuracy rates to over 90%. Tremor analysis also
provided an effective tool for detecting PD. The model has the potential for clinical use and can
be expanded to include other relevant variables.
